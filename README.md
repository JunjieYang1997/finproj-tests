# Final project tests

This git repository contains community-written unit tests for the
[Intermediate Programming final project](https://jhuintprog.github.io/spring2020/finproj/index.html).

The [tests](tests) directory has the shared unit test programs.  You are welcome to use these. Even better, we invite you to *improve* them!

If you would like to contribute your improvements, please do the following:

1. Create a fork of this repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Commit your improvements to your fork
4. Create a pull request

We will periodically merge pull requests, so you should occasionally pull changes from this repository to make sure you have the latest versions of each test program.

**Important**: this is a public git repository, and if you submit a pull request and we accept it, your name and email will be in the commit history! If you would like to submit an improved test program privately, you can email it to [daveho@cs.jhu.edu](mailto:daveho@cs.jhu.edu), and we will merge it. Please use the email subject "final project unit test contribution".

The [data](data) directory has example game files.  You are also welcome to contribute your game files, using the procedures described above.
